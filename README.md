Find Nth Derivative of function in haskell

Problem Question
Given a smooth function f, design a higher-order function to compute n
th derivative of f. Use the
higher order function to compute 2nd derivative of sin x at Ï€. Assume dx = 0.001.

HOW TO MAKE EXECUTABLE AND RUN PROGRAMME

Just Call deriv f n x function in haskell compiler t run the programme
here f is desired function and n derivative and x is the value
